It's one thing to create a sample RESTful API using Node.js (maybe utilizing the
cluster module to distribute the load), but it's quite another to horizontally
scale your architecture to hundreds of thousands of concurrent connections while
trying to ensure redundancy and high availability.

Knowing how to scale is important, but more important than that is knowing when
to scale. In this two-part tutorial, I will explore what it takes to create a
real-life, scalable, highly available, and highly responsive Node.js
application.

Here is the first part:
