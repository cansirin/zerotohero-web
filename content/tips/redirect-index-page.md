## Introduction

While migrating [zerotohero.dev](https://zerotohero.dev) to its new design, 
I needed to find a quick and dirty way to redirect incoming requests to 
certain websites to their corresponding pages on **Zero to Hero**.

This nugget gives a neat trick to achieve this with the least amount of
effort.

## `<meta>` Refresh to the Rescue

Since all of those websites were static sites backed by an S3 bucket, updating
the error page (`404.html`) and the index page (`index.html`) was the quickest
way to achieve this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
404.html and index.html are the same.
S3 bucket is configured to serve 404.html for errors,
and index.html is configured to be the default page.
-->
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" 
   content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  
  <title>Redirecting...</title>
  
  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; 
    url=https://zerotohero.dev/about/volkan/">
  <link rel="canonical" href="https://zerotohero.dev/about/volkan/">
  <meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow">
  
  <script type="text/javascript">
    setTimeout(function() {
      window.location.href = "https://zerotohero.dev/about/volkan/";
    }, 0);
  </script>
</head>
<body>
<p>If you are not redirected automatically,
  follow this link:
  <a href="https://zerotohero.dev/about/volkan/"
    >https://zerotohero.dev/about/volkan/</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

This way, I won't have to worry about configuring the S3 bucket to redirect
incoming requests to the new URL. And as a bonus, I can still keep certain
(*hidden*) pages on the old website without having to worry about them being
indexed by search engines.

## In a Nutshell

Here's a breakdown of the code:
 
 * The `meta` tag with the `http-equiv` attribute is used to refresh the page 
   after 0 seconds to the new URL.
 * The `script` tag is used as a fallback in case the `meta` tag is not 
   supported by the browser (*very unlikely*). 
   * The `setTimeout` function is used to redirect the user to the new URL 
     after 0 seconds (*i.e. immediately*).

For search engines:

 * With `<link rel="canonical" ... />`, we are telling the search engines that
   the alternative url is the preferred one.
 * The `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow">` tag is used to tell
   the search engines not to index the page but to follow the links on the page. 
 * Which is good enough for search engines to understand that the page has been
   moved to a new location.

## How About `3xx` Redirects?

The only thing I am not doing for the search engines is to set the `301` status
code in the HTTP response. 

That is doable with some [CloudFront][cloudfront] 
and [AWS Lambda at Edge][lambda-at-edge] trickery, but I feel 
it's an overkill. 

[cloudfront]: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/
[lambda-at-edge]: https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/

Why? 

* Firstly, search engines are a thing of the past. 
* And, secondly,  we already inform the search engines 
  about the change anyway.

## Conclusion

Hope you liked this little nugget. It's the fastest to way to achieve the task 
without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

Until next timeâ€¦ May the source be with you ðŸ¦„.
