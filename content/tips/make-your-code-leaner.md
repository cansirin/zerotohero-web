![Make Your Code Leaner By Extracting Methods](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/extract.png)

## Introduction

In this article, we'll see an example
of [method extraction](https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractFunction.html).
We'll make our code less repetitive, cleaner, and easier to follow.

## Duplicating a Method

Let's take the `SanitizeCrypto()` function
from [our former `fizz-env` module](@/tips/microservice-env-vars.md):


```go
func (e FizzEnv) SanitizeCrypto() {
    sanitizeCommon(e)

    v := reflect.ValueOf(e.Crypto)

    for i := 0; i < v.NumField(); i++ {
        val := v.Field(i).String()
        name := v.Type().Field(i).Name

        if val == "" {
            panic(
                fmt.Sprintf(
                    "The environment variable for" +
                    "'%s' is not defined.", name,
                ),
            )
        }
    }
}
```

What if, along with `e.Crypto`, we also have... say... an `e.Log` member that
requires the same kind of sanitization. We can come up with a `SanitizeLog()`
method like this:

```go
func (e FizzEnv) SanitizeLog() { // <-- (1)
    sanitizeCommon(e)

    v := reflect.ValueOf(e.Log) // <-- (2)

    for i := 0; i < v.NumField(); i++ {
        val := v.Field(i).String()
        name := v.Type().Field(i).Name

        if val == "" {
            panic(
                fmt.Sprintf(
                    "The environment variable for " +
                    "'%s' is not defined.", name,
                ),
            )
        }
    }
}
```

If you look closely at the replicated `SanitizeLog()` function, aside from the
method name and the attribute `e.Log` that we are reflecting upon (_`(1)`
and `(2)` in the source code, respectively_), we are repeating the majority of
the code.

## Extracting the Repetitive Code Piece

Instead, we can extract the for loop into its own method like this:

```go
func sanitize(v reflect.Value) {
    for i := 0; i < v.NumField(); i++ {
        val := v.Field(i).String()
        name := v.Type().Field(i).Name

        if val == "" {
            panic(
                fmt.Sprintf(
                    "The environment variable for " +
                    "'%s' is not defined.", name,
                ),
            )
        }
    }
}
```

## Calling the Extracted Function

Then we can call it in our methods:

```go
func (e FizzEnv) SanitizeCrypto() {
    sanitize(reflect.ValueOf(e.Crypto))
}

func (e FizzEnv) SanitizeLog() {
    sanitize(reflect.ValueOf(e.Log))
}
```

## Conclusion

Much cleaner, isn't it?

This approach is known
as [method extracting](https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractFunction.html),
and when done with a purpose, it can make your code **clearer** to read, 
**leaner**, and more **maintainable**.

> Just keep in mind that each method extraction is an additional level of
> indirection. So if you abuse it, you will make your code harder to read 
> (_instead of easier_), harder to follow, and harder to reason about.

Do this refactoring **only** when it makes sense. Do it only when the **benefits
** of doing it (_i.e., not repeating your code_) **outweigh** the liabilities of
doing it (_i.e., an additional level of indirection, making code harder to
follow_).
