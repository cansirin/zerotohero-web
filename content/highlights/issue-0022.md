![Overcome the Awkward Feeling of Networking](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/networking.png)

Welcome to the 22nd issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

For the last month, I have been vacationing with limited connectivity. Before
that, I was deeply immersed in [**learning a new domain of expertise**][o-ran].
So I hadn't had the time to create new content here.

[o-ran]: https://www.o-ran.org "O-RAN"

Well, I'm still learning many things and ramping up at work; yet I'm not that
overwhelmed anymore. So I'll gradually get back on track here.

The benefit of my ramping-up period is I've learned a lot of cool stuff, and I'd
love to share them with y'all. So expect some content around **network
virtualization**, **disaggregation**, and **Open Radio Access Networks**. Stay
tuned.

## It Was a Hell of a Vacation

For one month, I was mostly away from technology. Instead, I spent time with
family and friends, visited places, and had a lot of fun. And honestly, I needed
to recharge my batteries. And now I'm back on track.

Here's the last scene I looked at before I headed back to the
U.S.---Unfortunately, the picture does not give the viewer what it deserves: It
was mesmerizing to be there to witness the sunset by the seashore with a
crescent moon hanging above.

## What's Cooking in the Kitchen üë©‚Äçüç≥

I just recorded a video about "**_Ghost theme development_**." I'm not sure if
it will be premium content or if I will publish it accessible for all, yet it'll
be there soon.

In addition, I've started drafting a few things about **Open Radio Access
Network** (_or O-RAN_). **O-RAN** is a very technically involved topic with lots
of subtopics. I'll try my best to make it easy to understand, and I'm sure it'll
be so much fun to create the content. After all, I'm still learning it; I'm a
big believer in learning by sharing.

## Random Thought of the Week

You are not alone if networking feels transactional---even awkward---to you.

While networking, one of the things that you want to do is to make a good
impression on people. And maybe your mind goes blank when you try to do that. Or
perhaps you need to overcompensate your nervousness by talking a lot or showing
unrealistic enthusiasm.

That puts you in a situation where you know and acknowledge that you should be
networking. Yet, you have an equally strong desire to avoid the discomfort of it
all.

How can you reconcile these two opposing feelings? Here are a few tips:

Firstly, start by reframing your thoughts. This is a genuine opportunity to make
real, meaningful connections. It's not a phony, opportunistic interaction.

Secondly, consider what you can offer in that situation. It's not just what you
want to take. Networking is **mutual**.

Also, before meeting someone new, read more about them. This way, you can find
something interesting that you mutually share to break the ice. That will be *
*much** better than memorizing the "*right*" questions to ask to make a good
impression.

Yes, all of these can be done; it's a subtle mindset shift. Yet, it can make a
world of difference.

**One final piece of advice:** Don't try to hide who you are. Be honest---even
if that means openly expressing what makes you uncomfortable with this whole
networking thing.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

Exclusively hand-picked for you üëå. Enjoy.

* [In case you want your on premises Postman, **YAADE** is a self-hosted, open 
  source, collaborative API development environment](https://github.com/EsperoTech/yaade).

Thanks a Lot ‚ù§Ô∏è

That's all for this week. Next week, I'll gather more unique content and
resources.

So, until next time... May the source be with you ü¶Ñ.
