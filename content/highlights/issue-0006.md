Welcome to the sixth issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

This week, I did a lot of work behind the scenes, so there are not many new
articles to read for you folks. And still, I have a ton to talk about, so here
we go.

## What's New on **Zero to Hero** 👩‍🍳

This week, I was primarily focused
on [restarting the Zero to Hero live streams][twitch] and creating the initial 
API architecture of **FizzBuzz Pro**. Thus, there are no new articles so far. 
And there's a lot in the pipeline. For instance, I want to create a 
**learning roadmap** for the interested, which will be about how you can keep 
up with everything without getting overwhelmed (*hint: give yourself
the time you need---but there's more to it*)

There's one video about [Creating AWS ECR Repositories][ecr] that you might 
like, though.

So, stay tuned. Lots of quality content is on its way.

## **Zero to Hero** on Twitch

I started sharing my development environment, live coding, and chatting with
whoever bumps into [**Zero to Hero** Twitch Channel][twitch].

Nowadays, I'm mostly coding **Go**; yet I'll be all over the stack, from
containers to Kubernetes, to UI/UX design.

## Random Thought of the Week

I know you are working hard, and **deserve** that promotion, or the salary hike,
or *at least* the recognition. And that's not enough. So **are you making a case
for it**? Here's how:

It's true that, especially during the pandemic, people's focus was more on
"*sheltering at work*" and feeling blessed to have a job than fighting for a
promotion.

And since things are turning back to normal, it might be just the time to work
for the promotion that you rightfully deserve. Yet, don't expect your managers
and your peers recognize you. From their perspective, they are working as hard
as you are. You need to make your case for your promotion. You need to make a
case that you are already operating one level above you, and your peers already
know and approve of your hard work.

Here's how to do that:

**Stay connected**: This is important, especially when most of us are working
remotely due to circumstances. Build a solid relationship with your manager.
Ensure that you are having a one-on-one conversation at least twice a month, if
not every week. Stay on their radar. Make your work visible, share the ideas you
are interested in, and offer to help them in however way you can.

**Add value**: Leverage your knowledge, skills, and abilities to position
yourself as the perfect person to lead a project; become the **go-to** person
for particular domain topics. **Be a bridge** between people, teams, and even
business units. Show your superiors how people around you can benefit from your
assistance. Show that you can create an impact that exceeds your boundaries.

**Have a brag book**: This is important, and it's often overlooked. But, trust
me, two weeks from now, you will forget the vital feature you created today that
delighted the customers.

Three months from now, you'll not even remember the names of the people you
worked with within that project and how you made their lives better.

> Your brain is an amazing machine, but it is a **_grinch_** when it comes to
> remembering the historical nitty-gritty details of your achievements.

**Document** everything you do (*in no more than 200 words*). I've found out
that keeping a daily free-form **work journal** is excellent for this purpose.

Before the end of your workday, you can write into your journal about what you
did today and what you'll accomplish tomorrow. And you'll have a chronological
record of your achievements that you can brag about in your next performance
review meeting with your boss.

> Yes these might be obvious tips, but you know what's important?
>
> Actually **doing them**.
>
> Agreeing that they are great tips will not get you that promotion:  
> **Getting your hands dirty** and **working on** your promotion will 
> "*eventually*" get you that promotion.

So grab that pen and start scribbling in your work journal, and good luck with
your next performance review talk: If you start now, you'll be well equipped
when the time comes.
