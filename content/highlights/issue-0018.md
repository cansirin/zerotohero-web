Welcome to the eighteenth issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

It has been a while since I published the last issue, and a lot happened in
between. Here are some of the previous few weeks' highlights.

## Update Zero to Hero Articles

## GopherCon is Coming

I was planning to prep for my **GopherCon** talk but life got in the way and
I have a draft to complete. It's on _Dec, 18th_, so I have around two weeks.

So, if you don't see much content from me, it's because I'm researching in the
rabbit hole of Cloud Native Identity Federation, preparing for the upcoming
Christmas break, and mostly getting into the holiday mood where the entire
concept of time melds like a marshmallow.

## Random Thought of the Week

Work can be stressful. Especially when you are not used to
"*sheltering at work*" for so long. When the boundary between *work* and
*non-work* diminishes, you end up thinking about work all the time. Work becomes
something that keeps you at night (*in a not-so-good way*).

Honestly, the best of your work-related ideas emerge when you are not doing
work.
However, thinking about work "*all the time*" can also mean stressing about
work, which keeps you up at night or creates a constant feeling of anxiety.

Here are some strategies you can try to avoid thinking about work in the middle
of the night.

### Make a List

I might sound corny. But once you write down what you are going to do the next
few days, you offload them from your mind. You will feel relaxed.

Unfinished tasks cycling through your mind will keep your mind busy; your brain
will stay at a heightened level of cognitive action: Not the best way to put
yourself to sleep.

If you wake up in the middle of the night, remembering a task, find a piece of
paper, a pen, and write it down. You'll be amazed at how easy it is to let that
thought go and get back to sleep.

### Keep a Journal

Journaling has many benefits that you only realize once you start doing it. A
journal is an honest and private conversation with yourself.

Once you write down how things make you feel and your longer-term desires and
aspirations, you'll process those emotions from an outsider's perspective.
You'll observe them, rationalize them, and find a medium to express them without
judgment. That will reduce your anxiety.

### Be Compassionate to Yourself

Self-compassion is showing yourself the same kindness, care, and concern you
would
offer to a good friend. You are your best friend, after all.

Practicing self-compassion beats the shit out of the impostor in you: You'll
break the cycle of negative thoughts and self-judgment.

### Be Physically Active

Any kind of physical activity can help you decompress your mind.

I often solve problems much quickly by physically moving away from my workspace.
For example, I go out for a walk and do not think about work. The problems
magically solve themselves when I get back to work.

Trust me, when you move away from work for half an hour, skies will not fall
apart; things will be exactly how you left them off. So give yourself the time
you deserve.

### Meditation

Like self-compassion, practicing mindfulness, being fully present, focusing, and
observing yourself without judgment will calm you down. When you are "at the
moment," fully present, you don't mull over the past events, neither do you
worry
about the future events.

Calm down your racing mind. It helps a lot.

### Stress is Inevitable

Work stress is inevitable; it is part of life. However, you'll feel refreshed
and under control with these strategies and tips. Don't just read them. Try
them and make them a habit. You'll see that you'll sleep like a baby and wake
up fully refreshed, ready to tackle whatever the next day will throw at you.
