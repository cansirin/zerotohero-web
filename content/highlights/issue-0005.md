![Be Kind](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/kind.png)

Welcome to the fifth issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

This week was full of new videos and articles. It was a productive week overall.

Let's jump right in.

## What's New on **Zero to Hero** üë©‚Äçüç≥

Here is a list of articles that I've published this week:

* In [The Repositories, Tools, and Services We'll Use for FizzBuzz Pro](@/zero-to-prod/fizzbuzz-pro-repos.md)
  use case, we looked into the repositories and services that we will use in 
  **FizzBuzz Pro**.
* In [A Technique to Ensure Environment Variables Are Set Before Starting a Microservice](@/tips/microservice-env-vars.md)
  article, we saw a technique to ensure that our microservice does not start if
  any of the environment variables it depends on is missing.
* In [Make Your Code Leaner By Extracting Methods](@/tips/make-your-code-leaner.md)
  article, we saw an example of the **method extraction** refactoring technique.
* In [Let's Create a Syslog Logger](@/tips/lets-create-a-syslog-logger.md)
  use case, we created a **logging wrapper** module that logs messages to 
  **Syslog**: a standard network-based logging protocol that works on a wide 
  variety of different types of devices and applications.
* In [How to Work With Private Go Repositories](@/vadideki-geyik/geyik-academy/go101/how-to-work-with-private-go-repositories.md),
  I have a video setting up my development environment to work with private go
  modules and repositories. At the end of the article, there's a lot of extra
  resources and learning material to dig in, for the interested, too.

## Volkan Uses ‚å®Ô∏è

Ah, I've [created an extensive inventory of hardware, software, and tooling that I *
*prefer** using](@/about/volkan-uses.md)---I thought you might
like it.

## Random Thought of the Week

I'll keep this week's random thought short and sweet: **be kind**---it's more
important than you think it is.

Not only **be kind** but also **model kindness on your team** too.

But how do you do that? I mean, how do you promote generosity and kindness in
your team? Let's see.

First, start with yourself: **Take the lead**. Give compliments to your
teammates.

Sometimes, people are blunt and up-front. Yet, that does not mean they have bad
intentions or ulterior motives. They likely want the team's success as much as
anyone else. Be available, helpful, and present for them.

> Teams are cauldrons of bubbling emotions, and decisions are made by carefully
> considering everyone's feelings---along with other things.

**Never assume malice**. People can have different ways to communicate. People
come from different cultural norms, and backgrounds. Reaching consensus is
complicated with two people already; it gets more complex as the number
increases. Don't make it even harder.

Kindness is contagious: Small gestures can have a big impact.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

## Thanks a Lot ‚ù§Ô∏è

That's all for this week. Next week, I'll gather more unique content and
resources.

So, until next time... May the source be with you ü¶Ñ.
