Welcome to the 21st issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

Yes, everything flows; everything changes and nothing is stationary.

## Personal... News?

Well, it's about time to spill those beans (*at least to the devoted readers of 
this newsletter üôÇ*). Everyone will learn in a few weeks anyway.

Because of some of the surrounding changes, I paused content creation for a 
while. And now I'm back again üí™.

So what happened? Well, if you don't know Silly Cone Valley technical 
interviews, it will be harder to help you visualize how brutal they are. 
Preparing for them is equivalent to preparing for a Bar Examination, SAT, 
or something. I'm not kidding. It's flocking hard!

I have been interviewing for the last few months, and my main focus and energy 
were on the interview preparation. Since that process has ended, now I can 
share my "**_personal news_**" with you.

Farewell Cisco üê¨; Hello VMware üëã
----------------------------------

![VMware](/images/2022/04/vmware-logo.png)

Hello world. Hello stars. Hello universe.

As of mid-April (*2022*), I'll have my last day at **Cisco**.

I've been at Cisco for the last seven years: That's a long time to learn a lot. 
I enjoyed every single moment of it.

That being said, I also believe it's time for the next steps in my career 
journey.

I'm moving to **VMware** as a **Staff Engineer**.

In my new job, among many things, I'll initially be responsible for 
[**5G Edge Non-Realtime Radio Access Network APIs, Cloud Architecture, 
and Orchestration**][vmware-ran]. I know, it's a bit mouthful, yet it's 
exciting. There are so many new things to learn.

> after you get those vaccines, I'll soon figure it out üòÄ.

Ah, I'll be Kuberneting as usual too; nothing has changed in that part üòÄ.

This new opportunity will be technologically, conceptually, and architecturally 
"**_on the edge_**". I just cannot wait to get started.

## How Will This Change Impact... Well... Everything

Honestly, I don't know. This new job is **very** demanding, and I'll have to 
learn a lot, at least initially. Radio Access Edge Networks will be my main 
focus. This also means I'll move my focus away from some of the things I have 
been doing, at least until I get comfortable with my new environment.

To accommodate for the time that need for this transition, here are the things 
that I'm phasing out or changing my cadence:

* **FizzBuzz Pro**: It was fun to create an application around data structures 
  and algorithms and teach how to think algorithmically. However, it takes a 
  considerable effort, which I cannot find time for right now. So I shut down 
  the service. Of course, I have all the source code, and I may repurpose it 
  for other things later.
* **Twitch Stream**: I will do screencasts every now and then, but I won't tie 
  them to a schedule. It will be more like whenever I feel like it. 
  [You can follow me on Twitch to get notified whenever I'm online][twitch].
* **Zero to Hero**: I have to manage my time well, and my current job will be 
  my primary focus. I will continue to create content. Yet the content will be 
  more byte-size and practical rather than involved and instructional. So expect 
  to see more tips and fewer lectures here.
* **OpsBeacon**: I'll continue to add value to **OpsBeacon**, and I'll share my 
  progress here and on my screencasts. I don't foresee any changes in that alley.

That's more or less how I see things will pan out. As I said, in time, if I can
allocate more time, I sure will provide more content. But, at the end of the 
day, content creation is something that I do have fun with. I love explaining 
concepts, and I'll continue doing that as long as I have time available.

## Random Thought of the Week

Every success story that I've been a part of involved some luck factor.

Some people say that "*serendipity is not in your control*," but that's not 
entirely true. You don't **get** lucky; you **build** your luck.

Here is a way to build luck into your career:

### Serendipitous Networking

I don't know if there is a different name for it. What I mean by 
"*serendipitous networking*" is to connect with people just for the sake of 
connecting. You'll be amazed how useful [some of those weak ties you 
created][weak-ties] will be to lift you up.

[weak-ties]: https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/26/weak-ties-matter/

Connect with people to get to know them, with no intention to leverage them as 
a career slingshot. Instead, merely connect with them to find common ground. 
Learn their perspectives; learn their stories; know them.

Ask them questions about how they discovered their passion and what they like or 
dislike about their role or industry.

First, what you learn can motivate you to lead yourself to your next career move.
And more importantly, you'll have someone to discuss related things once you want 
to make a life-changing decision.

### Don't Fear Change

Yes, change is risky. Yes, change is unknown. Yes, change is uncomfortable.

Changes that feel out of your control can feel scary. Yet, try to see them as 
opportunities. What can you learn from that change? What aspects of it are under 
your control? And what part of it should you better let go with the flow?

**Change is good**.

Remember, there is always an opportunity to capitalize when there is a disruption.

Observe the change, and trust that new opportunities will arise within time.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

Exclusively hand-picked for you üëå. Enjoy.

* [Welcome to your **stellar neighborhood** (_best viewed with a Chromium Browser_)](https://stars.chromeexperiments.com/).
* [**Pipedream** helps you write less boilerplate code while connecting APIs together](https://pipedream.com/).
* [You have text examples, but you don't know what **RegExp** to write that matches them all? Say no more fam---Leave the job to **`grex`**](https://regex.help/).

## Thanks a Lot ‚ù§Ô∏è

That's all for this week. Next week, I'll gather more unique content and resources.

So, until next time... May the source be with you ü¶Ñ.
