Welcome to the thirteenth issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

I was on a **much-needed** family vacation, so it took a while to get back on
track, but I did many cool things in the meantime.

Without further ado, here are the last two weeks' highlights.

## All Your Ops Belong to Us

**This is a biggie**.

A couple of years ago, with a group of friends and colleagues, we jumped into a
startup adventure called [**OpsBeacon**][ob2]. The main goal
of **OpsBeacon** is to help the Ops and Support teams' days turn a little bit
brighter and help them **#sleepmore** at night.

  alt="OpsBeacon: The future of ops is autonomous."
)}}

I was the lead architect of the project and had the chance to try changing the
world. I worked with the brightest minds, the most practical thinkers, and the
most creative problem solvers I've had an opportunity to work with.

Anyhoo, life happened. Things get dragged along. And we decided to put the
project on hold for a while.

Well, good news. [**OpsBeacon**][ob2] is back, and it's
moving full steam ahead.

And I'm delighted to have the opportunity to lead and mentor the team again.

Keep an eye on [**OpBeacon**][ob2]. You'll hear more about
them from other industry experts and from me because they have the will,
knowledge, skills, and decades of accumulated field experience to change the
world. And they will do so.

## Synestethisia Anyone?

I've updated [**Radio ZeroToHero**][twitch] to display
AI-generated images based on the music that's being played.

It's a **mesmerizing** experience. [Come check it out][twitch].

> It's so much fun combining art, technology, IA, and visualization. Plus, it
> motivates me sit on the bench and practice piano further. I'm liking it so far.

## FizzBuzz Pro

I'm mostly done with the "*identity management*" APIs.

More videos and articles to come. I will also create more articles and use-case
videos down the line. Stay tuned.

## What's on the Horizon üë©‚Äçüç≥

Here are the first few priorities that I have.

### Make Everything Seamless and Streamlined

For example, if I want to be live stream what I'm doing right now, it should not
take. No more than a few clicks. Which, apparently, I can do it right now üòÑ.

  alt="Zero to Hero live stream as I'm typing these lines."
)}}

I have a second "*streamer*" machine connected to my work computer. I can switch
from the "**_synesthetic radio_**" mode, to "**_live stream my desktop_**" in
mere seconds. No preparation is necessary.

> I'll also create an article about that entire setup, but that's the story of a
> different day.

### Finalize FizzBuzz Pro APIs

The APIs that are waiting to be completed are

* Question/Answer endpoints
* Subscription/Stripe integration

And that's pretty much it. Once these tasks are done, I can focus on the UI of
the application.

### Help OpsBeacon in Total World Domination

Total world domination... in a good way. I'm sure it'll be an fantastic journey.
And I'm fully supporting the team.

ü§ò [**Go Beacons**][ob2] ü§ò.

But yeah, these are my top three focuses in the short term.

## Random Thought of the Week

### Nine-to-Five? I Don't Think So

**Move away from the nine-to-five culture**: It's outdated, it's disappearing,
and it does not make sense in a global and connected world. Instead, shape your
work around your life, not the other way around.

What's important is to get work done promptly, with good quality. When, how, and
where you get that work done should be up to you.

If you are leading people, **focus on outcomes**, not the processes. Explain
your desired results, and set clear goals, roadmaps, and expectations.

Of course, there will be occasions where people will need to be
together---physically or virtually---simultaneously. Yet, some of them can be
decided on an ad-hoc basis. And if there is an event (*like an "all-hands"*)
that everyone has to be present, it should be clearly expressed to the teams to
know how flexible their times are

But other than that, leave the work to those who know how to do the job. You are
leading grown adults; the company is not a daycare.

One last thing, make clear agreements around how you use the technology to stay
together. So people understand expectations of the online presence requirements,
the possible response times, and how urgent issues requiring immediate action
are handled.

### Disagreement is Okay

As a leader, you have to **encourage** people around you to handle **differences
**, respect one another, **listen**, and **learn**.

But how? Here are a few suggestions.

**Build an awareness of other's views**. Encourage sharing each others' stories,
mistakes, and vulnerabilities. The only way to build understanding and respect
is through everyday interactions.

**Welcome differences in opinions**. Lead by example: Admit that you don't know
everything and have an open mind to alternative points of view.

**Accept mistakes with grace and humility**. People may avoid conversations for
fear of saying the wrong thing or being misunderstood. Encourage that asking
dumb questions and making mistakes are totally okay. Give your teammates the
benefit of the doubt.

**Disagree without being a jackass**. Be clear that it's fine to debate as long
as the conversation doesn't turn into a flamewar of "_I'm right_" and "_You're
wrong_", Truth can coexist. Moreover, you don't have to accept someone's belief
to understand and respect it.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

Exclusively hand-picked for you üëå. Enjoy.

* [**SmoothDoc** is a tool where you can create MDX-based awesome 
  docs][smoothdoc].
* [An oldie but still valid point of view: **Fighting LinkRot**][linkrot].
* [**Fluid Typography** is a technique to make the text scale based on the 
  viewport size][typography].

## Thanks a Lot ‚ù§Ô∏è

That's all for this week. Next week, I'll gather more unique content and
resources.

So, until next time... May the source be with you ü¶Ñ.
