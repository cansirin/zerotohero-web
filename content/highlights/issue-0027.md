![Promotions Don't Happen Overnight](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/level-up.png)

Welcome to the 27th issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

This issue happens to be almost on Halloween night, so happy Halloween üéÉ to
those who celebrate.

Last week I did a lot of research and wrote a lot of content. I'm sure you'll
like it. Here are some of the highlights.

## Be the Next Version of Yourself

[**Be the Next Version of Yourself**](@/roadmap/_index.md) is
what I'd call the **roadmap of all roadmaps**; I strongly suggest 
you read this if you haven't already done so.

In the article, I tried to summarize my personal perspective on a path you can
follow to become a great software craftsman. While that's **not** the only path,
it's a path that will indeed work and help you become the next version of
yourself.

## Resources Every Developer Must Read---No Exceptions

The title says it all üôÇ. In [**Resources Every Developer Must Read---No
Exceptions**](@/roadmap/bedtime-reading.md), I provide you with
an **opinionated** bedtime reading list that will give you perspective. After
completing the bedtime reading list, you'll look at software development
differently.

## Grab Your Chisel and Start Pounding

[**Grab Your Chisel and Start Pounding**](@/roadmap/chisel.md) is
my take on why I believe "*reinventing the wheel*" is crucial for us to grow.

Assuming there is no true answer and continuously asking questions is better
than sticking to a presumed solution. Instead, dream a better dream and reinvent
to make it real.

## Don't Make the User Think

Knowing how and why the user thinks is essential. Knowing what makes the user 
"not think" and act instinctively can differentiate between a "good enough"
product and a great product. Knowing how to design usable, consistent, coherent,
and delightful interfaces is an essential skill.

In [**Don't Make the User Think**](@/roadmap/ramp-up-in-user-experience-design.md), 
I outline the importance of knowing enough user experience design to be dangerous 
at least, no matter which part of the stack you work on. Then I provide helpful
resources that can help you brush up on your UI/UX skills.

## You Liked Them? There's More Coming Up

That's all for now, but there's **a lot** in my drafts that are coming up in the
following weeks. Here's a small subsection of my drafts waiting to be published.

![Drafts waiting to be published.](/images/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-29-at-4.08.33-PM.png)

Drafts waiting to be published.

Next week, I'll prepare for my **GopherCon** talk, so probably I won't have many
published articles, but we'll see üôÇ.

On the topic of **GopherCon**...

## I'll See You At GopherCon Turkey (virtually)

Yep, I'll be speaking at **GopherCon** Turkey. Here are the details:

The talk will be in Turkish, speaker deck, audience notes, and any other
material will be in English.

I'll upload them somewhere after the talk and share them with you. I believe the
video will be recorded, too; if so, I'll share it as well.

It will be fun. It has been "a while" I've been away from the stage üôÇ

## Random Thought of the Week

A promotion is an exciting event. Typically, you assume more responsibilities,
grow up in your career, feel a heightened sense of achievement.

Though, getting promoted takes **more** than a job well done.

Even if you are a high-performer, exceeding expectations, you'll often still
have to convince your superiors that you deserve to level up.

Let's see what else you need to do to prepare yourself for the next step in your
career.

### It's All About Inception

**Plant the idea first**. Promotions don't happen overnight. It can sometimes
take months, even years, to build a case around why you deserve one. So plan to
have an initial conversation with your manager, clearly stating your intentions.

There are several ways you can do this:

* Mention it during your annual performance review.
* Or talk about it in your one-on-one sessions (*if you don't do one-on-one's
  with your manager, then you might want to ask them to set it up
  first---one-on-ones are powerful, and you have every right to request a weekly
  or bi-weekly one-on-one from your manager*)
* Wait until you've accomplished a primary strategic goal, and then bring the
  topic of promotion (*this one is my favorite because your achievement already
  starts building a case for you*)

Then you can initiate a discussion with something along these lines:

"I feel I've been meeting the requirements of my current role and the goals we'
ve set together. I'm happy to contribute and make a bigger impact. I'd love your
guidance about how I can assume more responsibility and get to the next level of
my career."

‚òùÔ∏è That is saying "I deserve a promotion" without saying "I deserve a promotion"
üôÇ.

### Do Your Homework

You cannot assume that your manager is aware of all of your achievements and
capabilities. More than not, they will need a reminder, **both** from you and
your advocates.

Yes, you'll need to build a network around you to advocate for you and tell your
manager that you do deserve a promotion.

Also, **document your achievements**. Every. Single. One of them. I cannot
stress this enough: If you don't demonstrate your achievement, you'll forget
them. And how can you expect your manager to remember your achievements if even
you cannot remember them? So write down every single win you've had, no matter
how small it is. In addition, keep a **brag folder** on your desktop, and put
everything you can brag about into that folder.

### Demonstrate Your Soft Skills

Identify projects that demonstrate your soft skills. Soft skills are
non-technical skills that show your ability to work well with others and
coordinate them when needed. Soft skills are crucial to your career growth. So
the more you can demonstrate them, the better.

* Show that you can take the initiative and go beyond your current role to
  collaborate with others in a high-impact project.
* Show that you connected with internal and external stakeholders to improve the
  team's outlook.
* Demonstrate that you can resolve a dispute with the customer or between your
  colleagues.
* Show that you can communicate effectively with impact.

### Present a Persuasive Case

Always keep the bigger picture in mind. Visualize to your boss how your
achivements have helped your team, your business unit, and even the company at
large to reach a collective goal.

However, keep in mind that there is a thin line between self-advocacy and
self-promotion. Let your colleagues promote your work. You just outline facts
and result that you have achieved. Stick to the fact you've documented that
reflect your track record, provide vivid examples of your performance and ask
your boss to review those cases from their lens and provide their point of view.

### It's Hard Work, and It's Worth It

Making a case for promotion is a tedious and demanding overtaking. So the
earlier you begin, the better.

Don't forget: Confidence comes from preparation. Don't let your case collect
dust until the last minute. Start **right now** so that you'll be ready when the
time comes.
