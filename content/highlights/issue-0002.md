## Hey üëã,

Welcome to the second issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

For those who are
new, [there has been a lot of flux recently](@/about/a-new-hope.md),
and things are slowly settling down. I've set a personal goal to create one of
these newsletters every week regardless of whether there's new content on the
platform.

Let's begin with this week's random thought: **Change**, and **Change Management
**, which is something that deeply resonates with me recently.

## Random Thought of the Week

When dealing with change, what are certain obstacles you may face, and more
importantly, how can you overcome them? Let's see.

The first obstacle that you may face is related to the scope of the change. When
you are dealing with change, more often than not, some **work** needs to be
done.

Humans are Optimist Primes: We underestimate how hard a transformative change
can be. So make sure to set **realistic** expectations. Make sure to put enough
time buffer around your expectations. Double that buffer time, then double it
once more: Yes, we are "*that bad*" at estimating things.

The second hurdle you'll face is the sheer amount of work that you realize needs
to be done. The good thing is, you don't have to do that all at once.

> Don't attempt to do everything and be everything all at once.

Take an **incremental** approach. You move mountains one boulder at a time.
Launch a series of **small**, **realistically attainable** projects.

**Change** is often not a path you walk alone: If several people or groups of
people are going to help you, make sure you **communicate** your plans. Ensure
that no work is unnecessarily duplicated; everyone knows how they will
contribute to your transformational idea. Make sure that they **clearly**
understand how the change will affect them.

One more thing: **Be transparent**. Don't hide the reason behind the importance
of this change (*to you and to everyone else*). **Share** what you can.

> **Sharing** means exposing yourself; exposing yourself will---high
> likely---inspire the people around you. They will support you even more.

## Recently on **Zero to Hero**

This week was hectic, so there are not many articles going on.

I have drafted an article about learning the Go programming language,
step-by-step, incrementally, but it's not ready yet.

Stay tuned; I'll publish it sometime around next week, hopefully.

I'm also planning to make small stylistic changes to the design for your reading
and learning experience. So things will get even better.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

Exclusively hand-picked for you üëå. Enjoy.

* [iconic.app](https://iconic.app/): Free, high-quality icons for your next
  project, from arrows to buildings, to devices.
* [RedKetchup](https://redketchup.io/): Free online tools to work on images,
  videos, and icons.
* [Replay](https://github.com/vimond/replay): A React video player facilitating
  adaptive stream playback with custom UI and a React-friendly API.

## Thanks a Lot ‚ù§Ô∏è

That's all for this week. Next week, I'll gather more unique content and
resources.

So, until next time... May the source be with you ü¶Ñ.
