Welcome to the fourteenth issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

This week, I started digging deeper into **Kubernetes** Security]. It
will be my main focus next couple of months.

> Since I'll be in **R&D** mode, I will create less content. However, no matter
> how busy I am, I still want to do these weekly reviews because I've received 
> **great feedback** about them so far. It makes me delighted that you folks are
> finding them helpful and informative---I will keep them coming!

Also, deep research on the subject matter will mean more articles and video
ideas in the backlog. Eventually, those items will find their place on **Zero to
Hero**---I see this as a **marathon**, not a race. And as always, I value
quality over quantity.

## FizzBuzz Pro üíª

Next on my agenda is setting up the **Stripe Integration** and working on the *
*subscriptions API**.

Here's the sequence diagram of actions that I have in mind:

Of course, things may change along the way, and I may update the diagram, and I
wanted to share it while it was fresh in my mind.

## Synesthesia Anyone?

[I've created a YouTube channel where I combine my **piano** 
interpretations with AI-generated OpenGL 
**visualization**][youtube].

I have four music pieces already. I'll add more in time. That's also a good
motivation factor for me to put my heiney on that bench and study piano. Win-win
üòÄ.

It's a **mesmerizing** experience. [**Come check it out**][youtube].

## Random Thought of the Week

When your team is diverse, figuring out where everyone is coming from can be
difficult.

It's not only diversity in culture. Today, a typical office environment can
include members from four different generations. The amount of diversity is both
an opportunity and also a challenge in itself.

And there are ways to reap the benefits of a multi-cultural, multi-generational
work environment. Here's how:

**Firstly, challenge assumptions**. It's easy to make generalizations like 
"*they are experienced, but possibly they have lost the fire in their belly; 
they are just resting and vesting...*". Debunk your stereotypes.

**Know your preferences**. Ask everyone to be open about their preferences,
especially around communication. Different people can have different
communication styles, methods, or tools that they prefer.

**Make sure everyone is equally heard**. Dur9ing meetings, make an extra effort
to ensure every point of view is heard and considered, regardless of the
person's level or seniority.

**You are a team**. Instead of sustaining the "_us versus them_" mindset, change
the overall theme and narrative of the environment to **respect** and *
*understanding**.

Encourage mutual respect and understanding. You'll see that everything will run
smoother, and things will get done faster.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

That's all for this week. Next week, I'll gather more unique content and
resources.

So, until next time... May the source be with you ü¶Ñ.
