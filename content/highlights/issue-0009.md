![How to Make Yourself Heard](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/dj.png)

Welcome to the ninth issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

Last week, I was a bit swamped, so I skipped the weekly update. Yet, I made "*
*_a lot_**" of progress in the meantime. Here, I'll out line some of that
progress.

## Radio Zero to Hero

For starters, [we now have a music station that streams cool music for 
you to get in the zone](https://twitch.tv/VadidekiVolkan) non-stop 24/7 üòÄ.

It even has a terminal aquarium üê† that you can watch all day---how nerd is that?
üôÇ.

Want to see it? [Come join the fun and **follow me** on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/VadidekiVolkan).

I listen to it instead of Spotify all day long. I have 1500+ (*and increasing*)
tracks that I've curated and mixed personally. You'll like it.

Aside from displaying ASCII fishes all day long, I also do real-time coding and
screen casting there: It's fun.

## What's on the Horizon üë©‚Äçüç≥

I'm planning to **Create an EKS Cluster** and deploy some of the services
that we've created in the former live streams to that cluster.

Once I finish the code of some of these services, I will write articles about
them too to dig into the architectural discussions I've gone through while
designing them. Yet, before, I want to finalize and deploy a
micro-services-driven app. I'd like that app to run in the cloud, on a *
*Kubernetes** cluster, as a MVP.

So there's **a lot** of progress; however, not all the progress is on this
site. [If you follow me on **Twitch**](https://twitch.tv/VadidekiVolkan),
you'll witness the progress closely.

## Random Thought of the Week

Do you hold back in meetings? Are you unsure how to jump in and make yourself
heard? Do you often go unnoticed when everyone is excited about a topic?

If yes, then I have a recommendation for you.

To make sure that you are heard, and your voice is in the mix, try **claiming
space**:

> Make everybody aware of your contribution before launching into the main
> point.

For example, instead of asking "*Can we look at this problem from the customer's
standpoint?*", you can ease into the issue. Instead, you can ask something
like "*Can we pause for a moment, step back, and take a longer-term view of
these metrics? I did some research, and here's what I found...*"

üëÜThis will capture your audience's attention and position you as a knowledgeable
person in your field.

Once you show that you have done your homework and know what you are talking
about, you can better articulate your proposal. This way, people can have a
sense of understanding of what you are suggesting before you get to the details.

Also, make sure to emphasize why your idea is essential. People in the room
should know **why** they should care to prioritize this idea right now (*among
many other things that seem to be equally important*).

Finally, don't stay in the spotlight forever. Invite contribution and feedback
by asking probing questions like

* "*What do you think?*",
* "*How many of you feel this way?*",
* "*What are your thoughts, it's not that crazy of an idea, is it?*".

This will allow people to think more deeply about what you've proposed, and
you'll have a chance to read the room and get a sense of how your message has
been received so far.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

Exclusively hand-picked for you üëå. Enjoy.

* [**TreeSheets** is an open-source free-form data organizer---it's like excel worksheets, but in a tree-like structure---get it? tree... sheets üôÇ](https://strlen.com/treesheets/) .
* [**BlueMonday** is an HTML sanitized written in Go---in case you need that kind of a thing](https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday).
* [Counting is harder than it seems. In his article, Bruno outlines ways to **safely** count in **Go**](https://brunocalza.me/there-are-many-ways-to-safely-count/).

## Thanks a Lot ‚ù§Ô∏è

That's all for this week. Next week, I'll gather more unique content and
resources.

So, until next time... May the source be with you ü¶Ñ.
