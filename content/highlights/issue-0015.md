![Pivoting Your Career?](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/pivot.png)

Welcome to the fifteenth issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

I'm still deep down into **Cloud-Native Security**. The good news is, I've
learned "**a lot**," and lots of quality stuff will likely come up your way.

On the topic of "Cloud Native," I asked the community what **Cloud-Native
Security** meant for them.

I did this on **Twitter** and other mediums, like **IRC**, **Slack**, and 
**Discord**. Then I came up with a 20-page "mini" bedtime reading material, 
a Cloud-Native Security DevRel's survival guide ü•ë.

## Cloud-Native Security Developer Relations Engineer's Survival Guide

I've even outlined the blueprint of a book. Not sure if I'll create a book; or
come off with a series of articles or both. We'll see üòÄ.

"Cloud-Native Security Developer Relations Engineer"? Wow, fancy title. But,
what exactly is it?

Here's how I defined it in the document.

> A **Cloud-Native Security Developer Relations Engineer** collaborates,
> partners, grows, contributes, and **hacks** with the **Cloud-Native** security
> community. They explore new venues find where the developers are, listen to
> them and engage with them, mentor and support them, and lift them.
>
> While doing these, they will also be the bridge between the developer
> community and the larger **Cloud-Native Security** ecosystem. They will share
> ideas, solutions, and recommendations, gather feedback, and spread the word to
> the observable universe.

Right now, the document has some Company-specific information, so I cannot quite
publicly release it. Still, I am planning to pivot off a more general document
for the larger community to benefit.

## SPIFFE Anyone?

I also looked into **Trust** and **Identity Federation** in the cloud.

![SPIRE Tutorial Audio Recording](/images/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-8.51.13-PM.png)

I have **18 minutes** of screencast where I deploy a 
[**SPIRE**](https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spire-about/spire-concepts/) server on 
an **AWS EKS** cluster and then fetch **x.509** SVID's from a workload. If it does
not mean much to you, I promise it'll make sense after watching the video.

The content is almost ready. It just has some post-production and annotation
work to do before it'll be ready for your viewing pleasure.

Along with the video, there will be an accompanying article that has been tech
reviewed by not one but two [**SPIRE**](https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spire-about/spire-concepts/) 
core contributors: [**Daniel Feldman**](https://twitter.com/d_feldman) and [**Evan
Gilman**](https://twitter.com/evan2645).

So it'll be **awesome**. Wait for it.

## Random Thought of the Week

Are you making a big career decision?

Changing job roles is hard no matter what the circumstances. So before pressing
the big red button, ask yourself the following questions. Once you answer them
all, you'll have gained clarity and narrowed down your options.

**How do you feel about the opportunity**? How do you envision your future when
you do the switch? Think about the kind of work you do right now. Now, think
about the work that you are planning to do. Take a pen and paper and write down
your ideas and feelings.

**Does this opportunity align with what matters to you most**? Knowing and
understanding your values will help you make choices that align with what you
care about most.

**How does this change will affect others**? Consider how your decision will
impact your family, friends, loved ones, the people you most care about. Then,
before jumping hoops, ask them for their comments, suggestions, insights, and
thoughts.

**What's behind that screensaver**? You want to make the right choice for the
right reason. Be objective. The grass will always look greener from the outside.
Though, are you considering facts and data, or are you considering your hopes
and assumptions? If you make your decision solely based on your _gut_ feeling,
be aware that you are taking the risk of disappointment in the long run. Gather
as much evidence as you can.

Once you answer these questions, and maybe **sleep on** the idea a little,
you'll better understand how to proceed.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

Exclusively hand-picked for you üëå. Enjoy.
