# How to Work With Private Go Repositories

Introduction
------------

**Go** works seamlessly when the code that you are working with resides in public repositories. However, suppose you maintain your projects in **private** repositories. In that case, you need to tweak your environment a little to be able to work with your private **Go** modules.

In this lecture, you'll learn:

*   How to version and export **Go** modules.
*   How to import **Go** modules.
*   And how to configure your system to allow importing _private_ **Go** modules.

Conclusion
---------------

In this mini video, you've learned how to work with private **Go** modules and import from private repositories; and tag, export, and publish private **Go** repositories. In the **additional resources** section, we also briefly mentioned various **Z-Shell** startup files.

> **Note**  
>   
> You can check out this **Zero to Hero** article about 
> [Z-Shell Startup Files](@/tips/zshell-startup-files.md) for more information

We'll have more fun with **Go** in the upcoming videos and articles.

Until then... May the source be with you ðŸ¦„.
