> Here, you'll find the instructions to install [**Go**](https://golang.org/ "Go Programming Language") on a **Windows** computer.

Open [the MSI file you downloaded](https://golang.org/dl/) and follow the prompts to install **Go**.

After installing, you will need to close and reopen any open command prompts so that changes to the environment made by the installer are reflected at the command prompt.

To verify that you've installed **Go**, type `"cmd"` in the Start Menu's search bar and then press the **Enter** key. Then execute the following command:

```bash
go version
```

If the command prints the installed version of **Go**, you're good to go.

## You Are All Set

That's it. You are now ready to use **Go** in your system.
