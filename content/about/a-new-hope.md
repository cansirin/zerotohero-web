Hi there 👋,

As you can see, this is the new **Zero to Hero**.

## So, What's Coming Up

Yes, his is ground zero. Yes, I'm starting everything from scratch.

This is a radical decision that deserves an explanation. In this article, I'll 
try to outline the **why**s and **how**s of this decision as best as I can.

## The Content

I will create one (*and only one*) kinds of content here:

* **Free**: Where anyone can read and learn from.

* Why? Because, simply, and very plainly: I don’t need to make money from this. 

I have a day job that pays well. Trying to make a living from this will only 
add unnecessary pressure and stress to my life. It will also limit my creativity 
and freedom. I will have to end up optimizing for impressions. 

**I DO NOT WANT THAT**.

I want to create because I want to create. I don't want to create to feed
an algorithm.

I don't want **Zero to Hero** to turn into a **content mill**. I don't want 
it to be a burden. I want it to be a **joy**, so that I can create more
valuable content, freely, without any constraints.

## The Pivot

![Pivot, change, and ignite.](/images/2021/05/saga-15.png)

Pivot, change, and ignite.

So what's the plan?

I'm recreating the existing content with a totally different approach:

I'll focus creating more **textual content**, diagrams and visualizations, 
source code, embedded code playgrounds, and the like.

I'll augment the textual content with videos only when it's needed (*like, 
for example, showing a complicated AWS Console setup, which is easier to 
**see** than to **read** and follow*).

There are several reasons for that:

* Creating video content is tenfold harder than creating a textual content: 
  Publishing a five-minute video lesson takes at least ten-to-fifteen hours of 
  time. Creating textual content is much faster.
* Editing, updating, iterating textual content is **much** more convenient:
  It's as simple as deleting some text, and adding the new text, updating images 
  and other references. Per contra, for video, you'll have to reshoot your 
  entire video, which will cost you at least another fifteen hours per video.
* Textual content is searchable and indexable: With videos, you can achieve 
  something similar with bookmarks, and annotations, but still it won't be even 
  close to the comfort you have with text.
* You can copy/paste, save, backup, mix and mash text. With video, it's 
  **a lot** harder to do that.

## Content is the King

> "Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard
> work leads to success. Greatness will come." 
> -- **Dwayne (_the Rock_) Johnson**

It will take a while to think about the **content strategy**.

I have a plan... several plans in fact. And I'll gradually get there.

> My first action item is to **maintain** a writing **cadence**: I don't know if 
> this will be daily, every other day, weekly, or something different... but 
> I'll reserve an **uninterrupted, focused, content creation time** on my 
> calendar.
>

> strategy; not before.

## A Change in the Process

I began working on "_JavaScript: from Zero to Hero_" around **2018**. The course 
was a video course about creating and maintaining your **JavaScript** stack in a 
real-life production environment, paying special attention to things like 
**scalability**, **fault-tolerance**, **high availability**, 
**disaster recovery**, **auditing**, **security**... As far as I could see, no 
one had come closer to creating a course like that. So there was **a lot** of 
value in creating it.

So why the sudden shift, you may---rightfully---ask.

By the time of this writing, it is **mid-2021**. And I am... more-or-less 
**70%** complete, give or take a few percents.

If I continue with this pace, my guesstimate is, the course will not be released 
before late 2023. And I believe, this is turning out to be an uphill battle, 
and I need to change my parameters to **expedite** the process.

Right now, I find myself lucky if I can publish one video lesson per week. To be 
upfront and honest with you again, I don't remember when was the last time I 
published a new video... it has been at least several months.

I have (*as of this writing, again*) around **fifty** lectures to add before I 
finalize the course. So do the math yourself 🙂.

> It is an uphill battle.

## Is Creating a Video Course Really "that" Hard?

But why is that? I mean, isn't that too much time for a **just** a 
"*JavaScript*" course?

Trust me, I thought about that too.

While thinking, I decided to put my thoughts into words.

There is a multitude of reasons, why the course took more than an average 
"*let's make an online recipe sharing web app with React and GraphQL*" course:

* Firstly, my responsibilities grew as I gained more clout within the company.
  This resulted in a more **demanding job**.
* In addition, as the kids got older, my responsibilities as a **parent**, 
  guardian, and a **spouse** grew. -- Not everyone knows this, but we are a 
  **non-neurotypical** family of four. And that multiplies the **attention**, 
  care, and **communication** needs orders of magnitude compared with an 
  equivalent "*typical*" (*if that's a thing*) household.
* Plus, the course was not "**just**" a *JavaScript* course: In the lessons, I 
  talked about topics varying from virtual subnet setups to lambda functions to 
  message queues... It was **deep** and **broad**. And I didn't want to 
  sacrifice quality.

Ah, as a cherry on top of all of this "'Rona" happened. We jumped into a 
seemingly endless year of lockdown, homeschooling, remote work, isolation. I 
call that "*sheltering at work*", and it's much more than that indeed. The 
lockdown amplified the emotional roller-coasters that we, as a family, were 
having.

## Resistance is Futile

I am an engineer. Always was, always will be.

Doing **constraint optimizations** is what I'm good at---one way of approaching 
the "*lack of time*" challenge was to set a deadline, set milestones, and 
pressure myself to reach those milestones as best as you can.

Pushing myself further would have taken me to the limits of burning myself out. 
I simply did not have the luxury to burn out, so I decided to find a different 
solution.

## A Quick Flashback

Let me add a few screenshots to show you how the course looked like.

The landing page.

![The learning management system](/images/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-04-at-2.29.18-PM-11.png)

The learning management system.

The application was truly slick, micro-services-based, learning management 
system. I'm planning to **rework** on it too, and share my progress here with 
y'all---although I'm sunsetting the current system, I'm proud of it. And I'm 
proud of everyone who has been with me through this journey.

Like I said, the goal of the course was to be something other than yet another 
"*Let's build a restaurant rating and comparison app using React and GraphQL*" 
course. I wanted it to be something that teaches you how a **real-life** 
production application was **built**, **evolved**, and **maintained**.

I wanted to create a platform where the interested individuals will learn the 
following the hard way:

* Develop robust, lean, and error-free apps.
* Create reusable, modular, and modern codebases that stand the test of time.
* Build, scale, diagnose, and monitor a full-stack production application.

It was an ambitious goal, I know. Still, I was step by step getting there.

## Then Life Got in the Way

As I outlined before, while I'm working on **Zero to Hero**, a lot happened in 
the meantime. A lot have changed both in my **personal** and **professional** 
life. The project almost moved to a halt. And I've realized a few things:

* The scope of the course was way too big to be reasonably completed in time.
* Creating a video-heavy content, while having a full-time job and two kids at 
  school age required a lot of **sacrifice** from my personal time and my 
  **sanity**.

I also realized all of this burden was creating a **very** heavy toll on my 
personal well-being and my relationship with my family.

> **Family** is where I draw the line. Family comes first; **always**; 
> no exceptions.

## Erase and Rewind

Eventually---and took **many** months of debilitation---I've decided to put a 
"**hard reset**" on everything:

* I've moved my Twitter to private.
* I've jumped off all other social media.
* The only medium that I've been sharing stuff for the last couple of months 
  is [LinkedIn][linkedin]

[linkedin]: https://linkedin.com/in/volkanozcelik "Volkan Özçelik on LinkedIn"

And during that time frame, I've been thinking about what to do... how to 
**restart**, how to **reignite**.

And this web app that you see is the end result of months and months of 
thinking, introspection, and self-reflection.

## Changing Perspective

After thinking about this **a lot** and weighing all my options: I've decided to 
pivot my idea into a knowledge-sharing system that I can populate faster, 
easier, without friction---almost naturally.

![Sometimes you need a shift in your perspective. sometimes you need a splash of 
water in your face. And sometimes you need 
both.](/images/2021/05/CXYEte2UwAAdugK-10.jpg)

Sometimes you need a shift in your perspective. sometimes you need a splash of 
water in your face. And sometimes you need both.

What will the new **Zero to Hero** be like?

Well, honestly, time will tell. I have a lot of ideas.

## Videos are Holding You Back

That said, creating visual content for the last few years, I realized that not 
only creating video content is holding me back, but also 
**videos are holding you back**.

Think about it: The average video course is spoken at 150 words per minute, 
while you can read at-the-very-least 250 words per minute.

I know this is a blanket statement, and people with certain conditions have 
hard time reading things. And to certain people consuming video content at 
2x speed is a much better to learn things than following text. But, in general, 
reading something takes much less time than watching an equivalent content.

In addition, you can read a lot faster if you have mastered scanning and 
skimming techniques. If you have read that thousand page brick-sized book 
before your final exam, you know what I mean 😄---try that with watching 
video lessons.

> With textual content, it's much easier to find your own pace, adjust your 
> speed, skip blocks of text, scan and skim the text to drill down further 
> later---that's the beauty of text.

Moreover, you can **search** textual content easily. Even when you have 
properly-set-up bookmarks and annotations, and transcripts, searching inside 
a video is **much** harder.

And this one is for me: Creating textual content is way faster than creating 
audiovisual content. I can create more valuable content faster this way.

That said, I also do believe there needs to be a **hybrid** approach: The 
textual content needs to be **augmented** with clarifying videos to show 
**how** things work when they work the way they work.

> **playgrounds**, other **interactive tools**.
>
> You can create an app for the users of the system to take their own notes 
> and annotate the content to their liking. Like you see a lot can be done, 
> and text is the starting point. It's the **origin**.

I'm also jotting down some of those ideas in my backlog, which will end up as 
useful **widgets** that add value to this new platform that you are reading 
and using right now.

## Nothing is Lost: Everything Transforms

Tangentially: Everything in life is based on three main forces:

*   Rotation
*   Oscillation
*   And Transformation

**Zero to Hero** is no exception to that.

This post marks **the beginning** of a **transformation** phase.

The older content is **not** going anywhere. I have triple backups of everything. 
They will find their place here in some way, shape or form.

## Onwards to a New Ride

This has been a wonderful ride so far. I cannot thank enough to everyone who 
have been with me. You mean **a lot** to me and words cannot express how 
grateful I am to have y'all by my side.

This is a new beginning.

Stay tuned: More will come.

May the source be with you 🦄,

Volkan.
