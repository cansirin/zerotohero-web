## When Reality Fragments

In the here and now, the concept of completeness arises from the limitations of
our conscious mind to distinguish the indivisible unity of matter. When
completeness is fragmented, it ceases to exist as a whole.

Consequently, our actions and choices are crucial in determining our material
success. Why does material success matter? Well, mainly because we are 
(_material squirrels_) living in a material world.

I like words (more than the average Joe) and bending and twisting them. I like
bending and twisting things, combining them, and re-using them in ways that are
not necessarily meant to be---which, by definition, makes me a hacker.

## There Is No Spoon

But, this braindump you are reading at the moment---while I'm letting my ideas
flow without interruption---is **not** about the hacker's mindset---I've have
written about
that [in other places](https://www.zerotohero.dev/hack-the-system/)
in [depth](https://www.zerotohero.dev/chisel/), a lot---This is more
fundamental, more to the **core**.

See, I often contemplate: Is finding purpose in any task possible, regardless of
how seemingly insignificant it may appear? Can I infuse meaning into everything
I do and be: in every aspect of my existence? What **truly** defines purpose?

Is it to be? Or to do? Or something in between in a harmonic, circular fashion (
which I sometimes call "**_do be do be do_**")?

Well, "do be do be do" is not as goofy as it sounds because **duality**, and by
that token **oscillation**, and by that token **rotation**, are the three
fundamental invariants that define everything, life, and the universe.

## Broken Is Beautiful

Even in the harshest times, I strive to maintain a realistic outlook, always
seeking practical solutions and outcomes. Trying to be good with weird, trying
to question the not-so-questionable.

The meaning of life may always remain a mystery, but I choose to live my life
with **sincerity**, joy and being the best version of myself.

I believe this is all we can expect of ourselves as human beings. Like, we will
never be a perfect sphere. Or, to put a positive spin on that, We will always be
**rough sphere**s, which is a beautiful thing to celebrate.

Sincerity... I do everything with sincerity and to the best of my ability. Is
that the **purpose**? Well, maybe. Or is it the question we seek but are
mistakenly trying to find the answer?

**We forget the question while we search for the answer**.

## The Mirror

Happiness, hope, and joy are the things that I purposefully and intentionally
radiate. So, if you ask me how I am, my answer will likely be, "I've never been
better."

## Acceptance

For me, and this very moment---as it is "the moment" that matters---I have found
a **balance** between _realism_ and _joy_ and a glimmer of the _sense_ of
purpose in my existence: 

I have found **closure**.
