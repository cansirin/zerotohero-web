I've changed the design of this blog, emphasizing its current impromptu nature.

Until recently, my plan for **Zero to Hero** was to let it evolve into a
learning management system. However, that resulted in me limiting the kinds of
posts and articles I could put here and pushing me to create more long-form
content.

While creating long-form content is beneficial, it's also time-consuming; that's
why I felt friction opening up my content editor and just writing stuff down.

Now, I feel **free**. I can write anything and everything, and I can do it
without needing a theme, a curriculum, or a target.

Per contra, the current design focuses more on the "**_blog_**" nature of "*
*Zero to Hero**." From this point on, "**Zero to Hero**" is, and will be, a
blog, **not** a course, **not** an LMS. It's a blog that I can write however my
mind pleases. Yes, it will be technical, but that doesn't mean I won't write
ad-hoc, impromptu stuff.

Also, my posts will be of varying sizes, some short, some long, some longer, and
some might be a book rather than a single post.

Here's a snapshot of the current design for reference:

I'll need to create new feature images for this new design for all the existing
posts, but that's okay. After all, I like what it looks like. And I'll create
more content faster, thanks to this new mindset, and that's all that matters.

Until the next one... May the source be with you ðŸ¦„.
