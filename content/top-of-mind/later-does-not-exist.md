!["Later" Does Not Exist](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/fire3.png)

All of a sudden, an idea hits you. For example, writing an article about why the
concept of "_I'll do it later_" does not exist in the contemporary world. Then
you decide to do that "later." Then, you realize "later" is a synonym for "*
*never**" and start typing on your mechanical keyboard just 20 minutes before
midnight.

Why? I'll get to that later **real soon**.

But before that, let's think about what "_later_" is.

What Does "_Later_" Mean?
------------------------------

What **is** "_later_"?

Maybe it's adding a "_temporary hack_" to be removed later. Perhaps it's
removing a bug, introducing a lower-priority bug, and deciding to deal with it
"**_later_**." Maybe it's temporarily breaking some test cases to deliver an
urgent hotfix. Or maybe it's stashing away your current work, to hack together a
last-minute customer proof-of-concept, knowing that you'll have **_time_** to
get back to your work "**_later_**".

Consider the actual consequences of your decisions: Are you honest with
yourself? Are you going to get back to that "_later_"? What if other emergencies
arise and you don't? What kind of risk are you introducing?

"_Later_" Has Many Forms
------------------------

There are other forms of "_later_," too:

* The most popular one: "I'll _fix it later_." **Srsly?!**
* Or, "_just add a quality gate exception; I'll add the unit tests later_."
* Or "I'll _discuss this feature with a greater audience later_."
* Or "_We can worry about security/performance/reliability later_."
* Or "_The code is working as is; we can make it more readable later_."
* The list can go on and on...

Yet, more often than not, what you mean by "_later_" is "**never**."

Because when you cut corners and create an illusion of making things **faster**,
you are giving the upper management, project managers, product owners, and your
customers a **false** sense of how quickly you deliver.

Rest assured, knowing how awesome you are at things, they will be expecting *
*more** of it---that is a self-feeding cycle: There is remaining work, and you
need to talk about it. Yet you do not. Hence comes more work!

In essence, you are effectively **lying** to your stakeholders ad infinitum:
Next time, you'll be overloaded with more work; you'll cut more corners. You'll
deliver much faster and be overloaded with even more work.

**Later will NEVER come**: You will start accruing a **_$#!%_** ton of technical
debt.

## Set Realistic Expectations

The best way to reduce technical debt (_and, by extension, increase technical
wealth_) is, to **be honest**, and set **realistic expectations**.

You are not finished with a feature until it meets the "_definition of done_." A
**definition of done** can include things like:

* Is the feature tested?
* Do key stakeholders verify it?
* Is there documentation?
* Did we do a usability test?
* Does it pass the performance benchmarks?
* Is it peer-reviewed?
* Is the code readable, duplication-free, and bug-free?

## Time is Candy

You know what, that doesn't only happen at work. It happens in your daily life,
too: When was the last time you added an article to your "read it later" list,
and you actually read it?

It all boils down to **time**.

Time is your most precious asset because you cannot recreate it: Once you spend
it, it's gone. So the only way to do enough things in the amount of time you
have is to **be selective** and **do less**.

**Have priorities**. Review **often**.

‚òùÔ∏è That's the only way to stay afloat.

Later üëã.
