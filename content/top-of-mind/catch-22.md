## There Is No Way Out

[Joseph Heller wrote the novel Catch 22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22),
first published in 1961. The term "**_Catch 22_**" is derived from a concept
within the book that symbolizes a situation where there is no way to win or
resolve due to conflicting rules or conditions.

In the story "Catch 22," a military rule traps soldiers in circumstances. It
states that if a bomber crew member wishes to be deemed insane to avoid flying
missions, they can't be considered insane.

This paradox arises because if they express a desire not to fly missions, it
indicates rational thinking---which contradicts insanity. Thus, they find
themselves stuck in a quandary.

## Why The Number "22" Then?

While "**22**" doesn't hold any meaning, Heller likely chose it for its humorous
sound. Initially named "_Catch 18_", Heller altered it to "**Catch 22**" after
discovering another book
titled "[Mila 18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mila_18)" had been published
concurrently to avoid confusion.

Since the book was released, the phrase "Catch 22" has become part of English,
describing a situation in which one is stuck and can't find a way out due to
conflicting rules or circumstances.
