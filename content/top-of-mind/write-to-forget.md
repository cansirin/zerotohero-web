![Write to Forget](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/write-to-forget.png)

Writing helps us remember things to hold onto thoughts, ideas, and information.
However, there's a perspective to consider; perhaps we write not to remember but
actually to **forget**.

## Give Yourself Permission to Forget

Please take a moment to think about it; when we jot down a reminder, capture an
insight, or make a to-do list, it brings a sense of relief and **peace of 
mind**. By externalizing and writing our thoughts, we can **declutter** our space
and "forget" what we just wrote. It's like giving ourselves **permission to let
go**.

Think of your written words as a storage device providing room for thoughts,
ideas, or reminders that would otherwise occupy our minds. It's like a canvas
where we can pour out ideas swirling inside us and lighten our load.

By freeing up space, we create the opportunity for fresh ideas. Our brains are
no longer burdened with holding onto information; they can now generate thoughts
and delve into deeper cognitive processes more freely.

This leads us to an open-minded state of thinking that is not restricted by the
need to retain information.

## Good Ideas Will Come Back

This viewpoint also reassures the understanding that if an idea is fundamental,
it will resurface. The subconscious mind can recall ideas when they're most
necessary, demonstrating its **power** and **resourcefulness**.

If an idea doesn't resurface, perhaps it wasn't as significant as initially
thought. It's a reminder not to cling tightly to every thought, acknowledging
the fleeting nature of ideas and the continuous flow of our minds.

## Grab a Pen and Let Your Mind Wander

In summary, writing to forget does not indicate a lack of importance.

* It serves as a strategy for the mental organization, promoting **cognitive
  flexibility**.
* It involves a **shift in perspective**, gently encouraging us to release the
  anxiety of remembering every detail, thought, and idea.
* Doing so creates an environment for **creativity**, **innovation**, and 
  **broad thinking**.

So grab a pen, express your thoughts freely, and let go. Through forgetting, we
allow our minds to focus on what matters.
