This is one of the best quotes about being **proactive**, embracing
responsibility, **adaptability**, and **transparency** in our actions:

> **Secrets** must be exposed when found. Detours must be taken when
> encountered. And if you are the one who stands at the crossroads or the place of
> concealment, you must never leave it to another to act in your place." (_from
Star Wars Episode 1_)

To break it down:

* If you discover a hidden truth or secret, it's your responsibility to **bring
  it to light**. Concealment often leads to misunderstanding or deceit, and
  exposing it can lead to clarity and justice. Be transperent, have trust.
* When faced with obstacles or challenges, sometimes the best way forward isn't
  a straight path, but rather to go around, adapt, and **explore other routes**.
  This can also mean embracing unexpected changes and turning them into
  opportunities.
* If you are in a position where you can make a decision, it's crucial to take
  that responsibility seriously and not leave it to others. Be **proactive**, *
  *accountable**, and **do not shy away from** making decisions or **taking
  actions**.
