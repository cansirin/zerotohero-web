## UX Design Matters a Lot

Knowing **how** and **why** the user **thinks** is essential. Knowing **what**
makes the user "_**not think**_" and act _instinctively_ can differentiate
between a "good enough" product and a great product. Knowing how to design *
*usable**, **consistent**, **coherent**, and **delightful** interfaces that help
the users achieve their goals is an essential skill that every developer needs
to acquire.

If you are creating something---"_anything_"---that someone other than yourself
uses, then **user experience design** is something that you have to know.

There are a lot of books and articles that you can find about the subject
matter.

I'd read the following two for starters:

* [Don't Make Me Think (revisited)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197267-don-t-make-me-think-revisited)
* [Design of Everyday Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things)

Those books are both quick reads and also are excellent resources to get you
started. After reading them, **Google is your friend**... I'm sure you will find
lots of quality books, articles, and tutorials about creating delightful user
experiences.

Here are a few of those resources from my personal stash, for example:
