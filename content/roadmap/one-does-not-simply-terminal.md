## Getting Comfortable With the Linux Terminal

Here are some articles you can read to get more intimate with the command line:

* [An introduction to the Linux Terminal](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-the-linux-terminal)
* [Using the Terminal](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal)
* [tldr Pages](https://tldr.sh/) (_easier to scan than_ [_man pages_](https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/)_, more practical_)
* [Explain Shell](https://explainshell.com/) (_paste your command, and let explain shell... well... explain it_)

Here are a few guides on the topic:

## Connecting to a Remote Server

[Connecting a remote server via 
**SSH**](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-to-connect-to-a-remote-server-in-ubuntu)
is something you'll have to do sooner or later.

> **Explore Community Docs**  
> If you need more than connecting to a server. Like, for example, if you need
> to install and configure applications, services, proxies, firewalls,
> databases,
> containers, and the like, then [**DigitalOcean**'s community tutorials](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials) is
> one of the best resources that you can have; closely followed by [**Linode**'s helpful articles](https://www.linode.com/docs/).

The only commands you need to master probably
are [`ssh`](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh)
and [`ssh-copy-id`](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh).

Below, I'll list some terminal emulators that you might want to try out too;
however, most of the time, the default terminal emulator on your operating
system will be sufficient for your needs.

> **Windows and Terminal**  
> If you have a Windows development machine and you are planning to work on
> Linux-like environments, do yourself a favor and give 
> [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
> a go. You'll thank me later.

## Cross-Platform Terminal Emulators

### Alacritty

[**Alacritty**](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is the **fastest**
terminal emulator that you can find around. It's fast, lightweight, based on
OpenGL.

However, when I say **lightweight**, it truly **is** lightweight. You cannot
find tabs, split windows, and other fancy add-ons that other terminal emulators
provide.

To be productive with [**alacritty**](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty),
you'll have to learn [**tmux**](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/) 
too, so that you'll have an equivalent tabbed user interface experience that you might be
used to from other terminal emulators.

> üíÅ‚Äç
>
> Here's [a quick and easy guide to **tmux**](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/).

### Kitty

[**Kitty**](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is another fast, GPU-based
terminal. So what makes it different than,
say [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)? It is feature-rich,
scriptable, and composable while still being fast and minimalistic.

### Hyper

[**Hyper**](https://hyper.is/) is an 
[electron](https://github.com/electron/electron)-based terminal emulator. It
is built on HTML/CSS/JS. Fully extensible, absolutely hackable. If you want
something customizable, with [hyper](https://hyper.is/) sky is the limit.

### Mosh

[**Mosh**](https://mosh.org/) is especially useful when you are, say, using your
terminal on a train, where connectivity is intermittent and unreliable.

It is a replacement for interactive SSH terminals. It works wonders, especially
over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.

### Terminus

[**Terminus**](https://eugeny.github.io/terminus/) boast to be a customizable
terminal for the modern age, and it does look pretty slick if you ask me.

## Linux Terminal Emulators

For the Linux UI fans out there, here are a few terminal emulators that you can
try.

* [**Guake**](http://guake-project.org/), is my preferred terminal on my 
  [**Ubuntu**](https://ubuntu.com/), mostly because I'm so used to
  the [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game))-style keyboard
  shortcuts to show and hide it. If you are a gamer, it becomes second nature to
  use it.
* [**Terminator**](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/) is really useful if
  you find yourself needing to split your window horizontally and vertically to
  see multiple terminal sessions simultaneously.
* [**Konsole**](https://konsole.kde.org/) is another popular option to try out.
* So is [**Tilda**](https://github.com/lanoxx/tilda).

## Mac Terminal Emulators

Mac Terminal emulators come and go all the time, yet there's only a single one
that stays and gets better year after year: [**iTerm2**](https://www.iterm2.com/).

While the default Terminal app is more than enough for your programming needs,
in case you want to spice things up a bit, you can try out 
[**iTerm2**](https://www.iterm2.com/). It provides a split window view similar
to [terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/), so if you come from the
Unix world and seek a similar experience, [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) can
be your ally.

### Windows Terminal Emulators

To be honest, I don't use Terminal on Windows too much; however, the following
are the terminal emulators I've used and liked over time. Pick your own poison
üôÇ.

* [**Windows Terminal**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701)
* [**Conemu**](https://conemu.github.io/)
* [**Fluent Terminal**](https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal)
* [**Powershell**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview) 
  (_it's a shell, not a terminal, but still **very** useful_)
* [**PuTTY**](https://www.putty.org/)
* [**ZOC Terminal**](https://www.emtec.com/zoc/index.html)
* [**Cmder**](https://cmder.net/)

## Shells

Picking a terminal emulator is the first step in the journey of making your
terminal experience better. Next up is **picking up a shell**.

[**Z-shell**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) is popular nowadays, and
whoever uses [Z-shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) also installs 
[**Oh My Zsh**](https://ohmyz.sh/) as a sane starting point in customizing their
shell.

There is a [zsh Quickstart Kit](https://github.com/unixorn/zsh-quickstart-kit)
that you might want to look at too.

[**Fish**](https://fishshell.com/) is another popular shell that is famous for
its autocomplete support.

Ah, there is also [**oh my fish**](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) to
set up your fish üê†.
