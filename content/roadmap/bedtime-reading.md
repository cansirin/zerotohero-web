![Resources Every Developer Must Read---No Exceptions](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/books.png)

This is an extension to [**Be the Next Version of Yourself**](@/roadmap/_index.md)
I wrote a while ago. Here, you'll find mainly language and platform-agnostic 
learning resources to help you become a better software craftsman.

I have roughly categorized the links in this document into sections, but they
are in no particular order.

All of those links below point to the books' [**Goodreads
**](https://www.goodreads.com/) profile so that you can read what others have to
say about them and decide whether to read them yourself.
