![Security Is Not Optional](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/securu.png)

## Introduction

No matter what you develop, application security, infrastructure security, and
having proper authorization and authentication mechanisms are critical. The
earlier you learn about them in your development career, the better. In
addition, you should keep an eye on the latest public vulnerabilities and
exploits to harden your apps and infrastructure.

Without adequately securing your apps and hardening the infrastructure that your
apps are running on, you risk having vulnerabilities that will be exploited
within a few minutes, if not seconds, as soon as your app is publicly available.

Here, you'll find some bedtime reading to help you dive into the security rabbit
hole.

## Conclusion

**Security**, **authentication**, **authorization**, and **identity federation**
are vast subjects. This article provided you with some links and pointers that
you might want to read to drill down further; however, it's by no means a
definitive list. That said, after consuming the material here, you'll have
adequate knowledge to do your research and build upon what you have learned
here.

That's all for now. I'll update this page and add more to the list as I see more
tools, resources, and techniques.

Until next time... May the source be with you ðŸ¦„.
