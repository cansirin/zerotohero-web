![Unlock Your Brain's Power: Learn Fast, Remember More](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/retention.png)

**Memory retention**is a critical aspect of your**learning**
process. [Research after research shows](https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/curve-forgetting)
that, without active engagement,**about 50% of new information can be lost
within an hour**, escalating to 70% after a day and up to 90% after a week.

![The Curve of Forgetting](/images/2024/01/curve_0-500x231.gif)

To combat this, here are scientifically-backed strategies to enhance memory
retention:

## Use Visual Aids

[Our brains naturally process visual and textual information combined more 
efficiently than just text alone](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/get-psyched/201207/learning-through-visuals).
Including**diagrams**,**charts**, and**images**as visual aids can assist in
encoding learning experiences into long-term memory.

This approach capitalizes on the brain's inclination to process data, making it
easier to recall the information.

## Embrace Pen and Paper

Even in this era where everything is digitized, there are distinct advantages to
writing by hand. [Engaging areas of the brain compared to typing and writing 
by hand can contribute to forming memory traces](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210319080820.htm).
The tactile experience of putting pen to paper can lead to retention of
information.

## Seek Demonstrations and Engage in Group Discussions

[Participation in learning through demonstrations and group discussions can 
significantly enhance understanding and memory retention](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4552057/).
These activities promote engagement with the subject matter, making it more
memorable.

## Share What You Know

Explaining concepts to others reinforces your understanding and helps identify
gaps in your knowledge. [Teaching is a method of processing information at a 
level that improves memory retention](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-014-0416-z).

**Learning by teaching** is my favorite; **for me, it works %100 of the time**.
When I explain something, I learn from the process of explanation and the often
unexpected questions the audience asks. It challenges the gaps in my knowledge.

To enhance the understanding of the concept that explaining concepts to others
can reinforce one's understanding and help identify knowledge gaps, it is
beneficial to link this idea to the Feynman Technique. [**The Feynman Technique
**](https://e-student.org/feynman-technique/), named after the renowned
physicist [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), is a
method of learning that emphasizes teaching a concept in simple terms to improve
understanding and memory retention. This technique involves four key steps:

1. **Choose a Concept:** First, select a concept or topic you want to understand
   better, just as you would when preparing to explain something to others.
2. **Teach it to a Child:** Then, explain this concept as if you were teaching
   it to someone with no background in the area, such as a child. This forces
   you to simplify the language and break down the concept into its most
   fundamental elements, similar to when you articulate ideas to others to
   enhance your grasp of the subject.
3. **Identify Gaps and Go Back to the Source Material:** As you attempt to
   explain, you'll likely encounter areas where your understanding is lacking.
   This step mirrors the process of identifying gaps in your knowledge when you
   explain concepts to others. You then return to your source materials to fill
   in these gaps.
4. **Review and Simplify:** Review your explanation and refine it, making it as
   simple as possible. This step ensures that you've not only understood the
   concept yourself but that you're also able to convey it effectively to
   others, thereby reinforcing your learning.

## Connect New Material with Existing Knowledge

[Establishing connections between information and what you know creates a 
knowledge network that facilitates retrieval](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00139/full#B12).
The more "**_unusual_**"these connections are, the better it will stick.

## Actively Retrieve Information from Memory

Instead of passively reading information, try to recall it from
memory. [This active retrieval strengthens your memory](http://www.educationalneuroscience.org.uk/2020/05/13/using-retrieval-practice-to-promote-long-term-retention/).
Improves long-term retention. It makes the information more durable and easier
to access.

## Read Aloud

[Reading aloud engages both your auditory senses, enhancing memory retention](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/12/171201090940.htm).
This multi-sensory approach stimulates various brain areas, making learning more
effective.

## Embrace Your Mistakes

[Learning from mistakes that are close to the correct answer can be highly beneficial](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/10/141027085426.htm).
These "**_educated errors_**" offer an opportunity to refine and deepen your
understanding, solidifying the information in your memory.

## Conclusion

Incorporating these strategies into your learning process can significantly
enhance your ability to retain and recall information. Each method utilizes
functions resulting in more effective and long-lasting memory retention.
