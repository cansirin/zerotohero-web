This quick video will create an [**AWS ECR**](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) repo
and set up our development environment to interact with it.

Next on my video production queue are:

* Going through the sequence diagrams of **FizzBuzz Pro** authentication,
  subscription, and signup flow.
* How to harden our **IAM account security**.
* And a quickie about **Ghost theme development**.

Once those videos are done, we'll start working on actually implementing the *
*FizzBuzz Pro** infrastructure, one microservice at a time; it'll be fun.

Until the next video... May the source be with you ðŸ¦„.
